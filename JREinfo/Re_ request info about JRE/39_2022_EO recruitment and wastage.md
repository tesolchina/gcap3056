**Note 2:** The Joint Recruitment Examination (JRE) score for shortlisting candidates to EOII interviews varies depending on several factors including performance in the JRE and the number of candidates to be invited.

**Note 3:** Due to non-existence, data like passing rate for EOII candidates in JRE, number of candidates interviewed by each panel, etc., is not provided.

## Summary and Action Items

### Brief Summary:
This document details the recruitment statistics for the Executive Officer II (EOII) position from 2017/18 to 2021/22, including applicant numbers, shortlisting criteria, interview processes, and employment outcomes. Additionally, it provides insights into the wastage (retirement, resignation, and other reasons) of the EO grade over a longer period. 

### Actionable Steps for New Candidates:

1. **Understand Recruitment Trends:** Analyze the trend in application numbers, shortlisted candidates, and interview passing marks to set realistic expectations about your chances.

2. **Prepare for JRE:** Since JRE scores play a crucial role, ensure you prepare thoroughly for this examination to meet or exceed the shortlisting mark.

3. **Interview Preparation:**
    - Understand that the interview spans several months, and prepare to be available for this period.
    - Aim to score around 70% or higher as this has been the benchmark for appointment. Review past example scenarios or interview feedback, if any are publicly available.

4. **Post-Interview:**
    - Expect follow-ups for academic qualifications verification, medical examination, and integrity checks. Ensure all your documents are ready for quick submission.
    - Consider your decision carefully if you receive an offer as there's a history of candidates declining offers; know this can impact your chances if you're on a waiting list.

5. **Stay Informed:** Keep updated on upcoming recruitment periods, as the validity of the waiting list lasts until the next round of recruitment, which could offer another chance if initially unsuccessful.

By following these steps, candidates can better position themselves for success in the EOII recruitment process.

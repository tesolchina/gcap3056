## Summary and Action Items

### Summary:
This document provides statistical insights into the review requests for the Joint Recruitment Examination (JRE) conducted in December of 2020 and 2021. It highlights the number of reviews requested, adjustments to candidates' marks, and subsequent invitations to interview based on these adjustments. Notably, despite adjustments, no candidates from either year were invited for an interview following the review of their marks.

### Actionable Steps for New Candidates:

1. **Understand the Review Process:** Gain a comprehensive understanding of the review process for JRE results. Knowing the criteria for success or adjustments can help in managing expectations.

2. **Prepare Thoroughly:** Given that marks often require adjustment after review, candidates should ensure they are thoroughly prepared for the JRE, focusing not only on the subject matter but also on the exam format and scoring criteria.

3. **Apply Strategically:** Consider applying for multiple posts to increase your chances if you are eligible. Data shows that candidates who applied for multiple posts had their marks adjusted more often, albeit not always upward.

4. **Review Your Exam Performance:** If you request a review, critically assess your performance to understand where adjustments might occur. This insight can be valuable for future preparations.

5. **Seek Feedback if Possible:** Try to obtain feedback from previous JRE sessions or similar recruitment processes to pinpoint areas for improvement in your study and preparation approach.

6. **Stay Informed:** Keep abreast of any changes or updates to the examination policies or criteria to adapt your preparation accordingly.

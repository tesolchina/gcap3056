## Summary and Action Items

### Summary:
This document clarifies that the Civil Service Bureau does not handle the scoring or breakdown requests related to the shortlisting of candidates for several government positions including Assistant Labour Officer II, Assistant Trade Officer II, Management Services Officer II, and Transport Officer II.

### Action Items for New Candidates:

1. **Contact Appropriate Department**: Reach out directly to the relevant government departments where these positions are listed to inquire about the selection process and criteria.

2. **Prepare for Other Selection Methods**: Since the interview scoring is not managed by CSB, prepare for potential other selection methods such as written tests, panel interviews, or aptitude tests which might be conducted by the hiring department.

3. **Understand Recruitment Policies**: Familiarize yourself with the general recruitment policy of the government sectors from official HR policy documents or government recruitment websites.

4. **Feedback on Application**: If there is a need for feedback on your application or the shortlisting process, communicate with the recruitment or HR department of the respective posts directly, not with CSB.

5. **Stay Updated**: Keep an eye on any updates or changes in recruitment strategies that might be posted by the individual departments or through official government job portals.

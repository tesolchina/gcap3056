2. **Interview Invitations:** There was only one round of selection interviews for EOII.

3. **Data Availability:** Personal data of unsuccessful applicants from the 2016/17 recruitment exercise were destroyed 24 months after their application was confirmed unsuccessful. Thus, detailed information from that year is not available.

## Summary and Action Items

### Summary:
The document provides detailed statistics on the Executive Officer II (EOII) recruitment exercises and resignations from 2016 to 2021. Key points include the number of applicants, candidates invited for examinations and interviews, offers made, offers declined, and the number of resignations each year. There's a notable decrease in applications over the years and an increase in resignations particularly in 2021.

### Action Items for New Candidates:
1. **Prepare for Common Recruitment Examination:** Since passing the Common Recruitment Examination is necessary for progressing to the Joint Recruitment Examination (JRE), ensure you are well-prepared by understanding the exam format, practicing past papers, and reviewing necessary subjects.

2. **Application Awareness:** Be aware that your application might not be retained for long if unsuccessful due to data destruction policies. Repeated attempts might be necessary if not selected initially.

3. **Stay Informed:** Keep up-to-date with recruitment dates and changes in the application process or examination syllabus. Check official websites or notifications for any updates.

4. **Career Planning:** Consider the career path of an EOII, including job nature, responsibilities, resignation trends, and career progression. This can help in making an informed decision regarding your interest in this role.

5. **Feedback:** If possible, seek feedback from current or previous EOII candidates to understand the recruitment process better and what might give you an edge during the interview.

6. **Resilience and Patience:** Understand that the process can be competitive with only a small fraction of applicants ultimately receiving offers. Prepare for potential rejection and be ready to reapply if necessary.

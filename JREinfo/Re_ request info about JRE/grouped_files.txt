Review past example scenarios or interview feedback, if any are publicly available.  4. **Post-Interview:**     - Expect follow-ups for academic qualifications verification, medical examination, and integrity checks. Ensure all your documents are ready for quick submission.     - Consider your decision carefully if you receive an offer as there's a history of candidates declining offers; know this can impact your chances if you're on a waiting list.  5. **Stay Informed:** Keep updated on upcoming recruitment periods, as the validity of the waiting list lasts until the next round of recruitment, which could offer another chance if initially unsuccessful.  By following these steps, candidates can better position themselves for success in the EOII recruitment process. ```

Summary: **Summary:** This document provides an overview of the recruitment process, detailing the number of applications received, how many applicants were eligible for various stages of the process, the number of offers made, and the response to specific information requests regarding the ranks and departments of applicants. The government declines to provide certain detailed applicant information due to confidentiality commitments.  **Actionable Steps for Candidates:**  1. **Understand Recruitment Process:** Know that applications are initially screened for eligibility. If you pass the eligibility check, you proceed to the written test, which seems to be a gateway for all eligible applicants.  2. **Prepare for Written Tests:** Given that 100% of eligible applicants are invited to the written test, it is crucial to prepare thoroughly for this stage as it likely filters out a large number of applicants before interviews.  3. **Review Past Tests:** If possible, find out from current employees or through online forums what past tests have looked like to prepare specifically for the format.  4. **Interview Preparation:** Out of 1398 eligible applicants, only a small percentage proceed to interviews. Tailor your interview preparations towards the competencies and skills relevant to government roles.  5. **Understand Confidentiality:** Be aware that any personal information provided during the application process is treated with confidentiality due to agreements between the government and applicants. Respect this when requesting information or discussing your application.  6. **Check Government Codes:** If you have further inquiries or specific information requests, review the Government's Code on Access to Information (section 2.14) to understand restrictions on information disclosure.   7. **Follow Up:** If you have not received feedback after what you feel is a reasonable time frame, consider a polite follow-up to inquire about the status of your application or when to expect feedback.

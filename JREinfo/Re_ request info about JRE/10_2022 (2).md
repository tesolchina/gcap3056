## Recruitment Goals and Final Appointments for Executive Officers in 2019/20 and 2020/21

Here are the recruitment targets and the final number of appointments for the Executive Officer (EO) recruitment for fiscal years 2019/20 and 2020/21:

| Year           | Recruitment Target | Final Appointments |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 2019/20        | 45                 | 29                 |
| 2020/21        | 45                 | 26                 |

**Note**: The recruitment targets published in news releases do not reflect the current vacancies in the Executive Officer grade. As outlined in previous communications, we will conduct recruitment and promotion exercises as required by the staffing needs of the EO grade, arranging suitable candidates for positions at various ranks. If positions remain unfilled, we will consider temporary or other arrangements based on established mechanisms and related factors.

Regarding the establishment of a **waitlist** for recruitment exercises, we consider several factors:

- The duration of each recruitment campaign.
- The interval between recruitment exercises.
- The acceptance rate of job offers by candidates.

Given these considerations, we have determined that there is no need to establish a waitlist for Executive Officer recruitment.

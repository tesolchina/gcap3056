## Summary and Action Items

**Summary:**
The content outlines the number of applicants for executive officer positions in the public service over a span from the 2011/12 to 2020/21 fiscal years. Notably, detailed figures for the earlier years up to 2016/17 are not available due to the destruction of records, while from 2017/18 onwards, the number of applicants has been recorded, showing a slight decrease over time until a small rise in the last year.

**Action Items for Candidates:**
1. **Monitor Application Trends**: Keep an eye on the recent application numbers to gauge the competition level for the next recruitment cycle. A higher number of applicants could mean a more competitive selection process.

2. **Prepare Early**: Given the high application numbers, starting preparation early for the exams or interviews would be advantageous. This includes understanding the examination format, sample questions, and possibly attending preparatory courses or workshops.

3. **Understanding Job Demands**: Since historical data from certain years isn't available, speak with current or former employees, or review available job descriptions to understand the role's demands and expectations better.

4. **Tailor Applications**: With the application numbers varying significantly, ensure your application stands out by tailoring your resume and cover letter to highlight the qualities desired for executive positions in public service.

5. **Stay Updated**: Regularly check government recruitment portals or subscribe to updates from relevant recruitment bodies to stay informed about upcoming opportunities and changes in recruitment policies or procedures.

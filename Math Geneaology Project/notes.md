I started working on this project 16 Feb 2025 
the main purpose is to demonstrate how we can write a computer program to download the data from https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/index.php
so far we have written a program to read an URL https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=316848 to check if it is valid 
320807 records as of 16 February 2025 (according to the page here https://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/index.php 
so we should be able to visit all the links 
then we need to figure out how to save the data from the pages 
we've got /workspaces/gcap3056/Math Geneaology Project/results/YitangZHANG.html to study the content and locate only the useful info

# Drafting Process

My approach to drafting this article began with a comprehensive review of
DeepSeek and its unique features, particularly its reasoning capabilities. I
engaged with multiple LLMs including DeepSeek, Perplexity, and Kimi to gather
varied perspectives on educational applications of AI. 1. **Research Phase:** I
started by gathering data on DeepSeek's development, its open-source nature, and
its performance metrics. This involved looking into academic articles, tech
blogs, and direct interaction with the model to understand its reasoning
capabilities. 2. **Conceptualization:** I conceptualized how these features
could impact higher education. I focused on two main areas: - The transparency
in AI reasoning could demystify AI for educators and students, thus enhancing
trust and educational value. - The lower cost of training could democratize
access to advanced AI tools. 3. **Writing Strategy:** - **Introduction:** Set
the stage by introducing DeepSeek and its significance in AI development. -
**Reasoning Section:** Argued how DeepSeek's transparency in reasoning could be
a game-changer for educational practices, providing examples where possible. -
**Cost Implications:** Linked the lower training costs to broader access and the
potential for creating tailored educational tools via API. 4. **Drafting:** I
drafted each section, ensuring to blend technical insights with educational
implications, keeping the tone scholarly yet accessible. I used real-world
examples where AI's reasoning process was transparent to illustrate points. 5.
**Review and Refinement:** After drafting, I reviewed the piece for coherence,
ensuring that the argument flowed logically from the introduction to the
conclusion, maintaining a balance between technical detail and educational
relevance.

# Draft

**Introduction** 

DeepSeek, developed by a Chinese tech company, has recently taken the AI community by storm. This AI model not only showcases exceptional reasoning capabilities but does so at a fraction of the usual training costs, potentially reshaping the landscape of higher education. The implications of DeepSeek's features for universities, educators, and students are profound, offering both opportunities and new challenges. 

**Reasoning about DeepSeek's Reasoning** 
The transparency in DeepSeek's reasoning process marks a significant shift from the often criticized 'black box' nature of AI. By allowing users to understand how conclusions are reached, DeepSeek addresses concerns about AI's lack of explainability. For instance, when asked to solve a complex mathematical problem, DeepSeek not only provides the answer but also outlines the mathematical steps, akin to a human tutor. This feature enables users to validate AI's responses, opening up avenues for feedback and improvement in AI's reasoning process. From an educational perspective, this transparency can significantly reduce instances of AI misuse for cheating. Rather than merely
providing answers, DeepSeek's reasoning mode educates students on problem-solving strategies. Educators can leverage this by adopting similar 'think
aloud' protocols in their teaching, enhancing students' understanding through
demonstrated reasoning. This shift encourages a deeper engagement with content,
where the focus is not just on the answer but on the critical thinking process
leading to it. 

**The Low Training Cost of DeepSeek and Its Implications** 

The development of DeepSeek at a significantly lower cost challenges the narrative
that AI requires vast computational resources. This has spurred discussions in
the capital market about AI investment strategies. For the education sector,
this means that advanced AI tools like DeepSeek could become more accessible,
reducing the reliance on expensive solutions like OpenAI's DeepResearch.
Moreover, with reduced costs, educational institutions can now afford to develop
or customize AI models for specific educational contexts. The current model of
interacting with AI through web browsers is inefficient for deep integration
into educational workflows. Instead, using APIs to communicate directly with AI
models like DeepSeek allows for the creation of tailored educational
applications. This approach not only enhances functionality but also promotes an
open ecosystem where AI development benefits from collective input, as evidenced
by DeepSeek's open-source strategy. 

**Conclusion** DeepSeek's arrival heralds a
new era where AI in education isn't just about providing information but about
enhancing understanding and critical thinking. Its open-source model, combined
with its reasoning transparency, positions it as a tool that can democratize
AI's educational applications, making them more accessible and useful for both
students and educators.

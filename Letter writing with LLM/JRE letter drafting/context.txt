I am writing about the JRE exam- Joint Recruitment Exam in Hong Kong that recruit civil servants such as Administrative Officer
and Executive Officer. Candidates have to take the exam for 3 hours to write an English essay and a Chinese essay. The topics 
are on some controversial public policy issues. One topic addressed in the Dec 2024 was the HKD2 concession scheme-
another topic is on regulations on claw machines 

The exam is very challenging. The passing rate for Chinese written test in 2023 was 46% and for English was only 36%. 
In 2023, a total of 20,900 applicants registered for the exam but the absence rate was 39% which was the highest in the recent 5 years

It is possible for candidates to request scores of the exams but such info is not made publicly available on the Civil Service Bureau 
website. One has to make a personal data access or correction request through a complicated form from PCPD Privacy Commissioner

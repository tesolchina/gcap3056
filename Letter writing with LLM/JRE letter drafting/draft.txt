**Letter to the Editor**  The Joint Recruitment Examination (JRE), a critical
gateway for aspiring civil servants in Hong Kong, has faced scrutiny due to its
transparency and preparation resources. In 2023, the exam drew 20,900
applicants, yet a significant number received regret letters on February 14,
2025, after the exam in December 2024. The passing rate for the English written
test was a mere 36%, with a high absence rate of 39%, the highest in recent
years.  To address these challenges, the Civil Service Bureau should take
several steps to enhance the fairness and efficiency of the JRE:  - **Release
Full Set of Mock Exam Papers**: Candidates need a realistic preview of what to
expect. By providing a full set of mock exam papers, especially focusing on the
essay components discussing public policy issues, the Bureau would ensure all
candidates can prepare equally.  - **Disclose Detailed Marking Schemes**:
Transparency in how exams are graded would level the playing field. This would
prevent reliance on insider knowledge, which might currently benefit graduates
from certain universities.  - **Introduce a Nominal Exam Fee**: Charging a small
fee, around HKD 100, could encourage candidates to take the exam more seriously,
reducing the high absence rate. This fee could be refunded upon attendance.  -
**Collaborate with Universities**: Partnering with Language Centres at local
universities to offer tailored training would bolster candidates' writing and
critical thinking skills, specifically in the context of public policy debate,
preparing them more effectively for the JRE.  These measures would not only make
the JRE process more equitable but also ensure that it effectively identifies
the most capable and dedicated candidates for civil service roles, thereby
strengthening our public administration.  Sincerely,  Dr Simon Wang   Lecturer

Joint Recruitment Exam should be more transparent 

On 14 Feb many candidates of Joint Recruitment Examination (JRE) held in December last year received their regret letters from the Civil Service Bureau. JRE is an annual 3-hour written test requiring aspiring public servants to write two essays in English and Chinese to discuss controversial policy issues. Last year, candidates wrote about the HKD2 transportation subsidy scheme, regulation of claw machines, shortage of dental services and flexible work arrangement. While over 20,000 applicants signed up for the exam in 2023, nearly 40% of them did not show up. The passing rates (to earn 80 out of 200) were 46% for Chinese and 36% for English. 

The Civil Service Bureau should collect a deposit of HKD 500 from the candidates who could be refunded after taking the exam to reduce the absence rate. It should also release a full set of model exam questions including data files and marking scheme to help the candidates better understand the expectations of the examiners. While the candidates can request their JRE scores by making personal data access or correction requests, the procedures were not widely known and complicated. The Bureau should simplify the procedures and return the candidates not just their scores but their answers, similar to the Diploma of Secondary Examinations for university entrance. 

Joint Recruitment Exam is not just a test for the government to recruit civil servants. It offers a great opportunity for young people to practice their critical thinking and writing skills while reflecting on the important public policy issues. The government should partner with the Language Centres of local universities to offer training courses on JRE and harness its pedagogical potential.

**Letter to the Editor**  

The Joint Recruitment Examination (JRE) for civil
service positions in Hong Kong is a crucial gateway for aspiring public
servants expecting the . In 2023, the exam attracted 20,900 applicants, yet many were sent
regret letters on February 14, 2025, indicating the exam's stringent standards.
The passing rate for the English written test was a mere 36%, and a high 39% of
candidates did not even show up, marking the highest absence rate in recent
years.  To improve this process, the Civil Service Bureau should consider
several key reforms. Firstly, releasing a full set of mock exam papers would
provide candidates with a realistic preview of the exam's demands, especially
for the essay components which delve into complex public policy issues. This
transparency would level the playing field, ensuring that all candidates,
regardless of their educational background, have equal preparation
opportunities.  Secondly, disclosing detailed marking schemes would promote
fairness by allowing candidates to understand how their work will be evaluated,
rather than leaving some at a disadvantage due to insider information.
Moreover, introducing a nominal fee of HKD 100 could encourage candidates to
treat the examination with the seriousness it deserves, potentially reducing the
high absence rate.  Finally, collaboration with university Language Centres
could be pivotal. Such partnerships would offer targeted training to enhance
students' writing and critical thinking skills, specifically tailored to the
nuances of public policy debate, preparing them more effectively for the JRE.
These steps would not only make the examination process more equitable and
transparent but also ensure that the most capable and dedicated candidates are
selected for civil service roles.

nature. Additionally, the absence rate was a staggering 39%, the highest in five
years.  To address these issues, the Civil Service Bureau should consider the

papers would give candidates a clearer idea of what to expect, especially in the
essay components on public policy issues. Transparency in exam content would
level the playing field.  2. **Detailed Marking Schemes**: Making marking
schemes public would ensure fairness, preventing reliance on insider information
that might advantage graduates from certain universities.  3. **Exam Fee
Introduction**: Charging a nominal fee of HKD 100 could deter no-shows,
emphasizing the exam's importance and reducing the high absence rate.  4.

to offer specialized training would enhance students' writing and critical
thinking skills in the context of public policy debates, better preparing them

**Letter to the Editor**  I am writing to urge the Civil Service Bureau to adopt
several measures to enhance the transparency and equity of the Joint Recruitment
Examination (JRE).   Firstly, the Bureau should release a comprehensive set of
mock exam papers. This would provide candidates with a clear understanding of
the examination's expectations, particularly for the essay components on
controversial public policy issues. Additionally, disclosing detailed marking
schemes would ensure all candidates are on a level playing field, rather than
relying on insider information which some university graduates might have.
Secondly, to reduce the high absence rate and encourage candidates to take the
exam more seriously, a nominal fee of HKD 100 could be charged. This fee would
not only deter no-shows but also reflect the importance and seriousness of the
examination process.  Lastly, collaboration with university Language Centres is
essential. Such partnerships could offer specialized training to students,
focusing on writing and critical thinking skills pertinent to public policy
debates, thereby better preparing them for the challenges of the JRE.  These
changes would not only make the examination process more equitable but also more
effective in selecting the best candidates for civil service roles.  Sincerely,

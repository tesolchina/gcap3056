refer to the Joint Recruitment Exam background - its purpose 
number of applicants in 2023 
many applicants received regret letters on 14 Feb 
low passing rate

=======
Please draft a letter of about 200 words to make the following argument 
- the Civil Service Bureau should release a full set of mock exam papers so the candidates know what to expect
they should also release the detailed marking schemes so all applicants are on the level playing field (rather than just some 
graduates from certain univerisities would have more insiders' info)
- they may also charge a small amount of exam fees (e.g. HKD 100) so the candidates will take them more seriously and not to skip the Examinations
- finally the Civil Service Servant should collaborate with the university Language Centres to offer training to students
to cultivate their writing and critical thinking skills in the context of public policy debate

<p>The texts above are basically the outcome of the project. Students are expected to produce such texts at the end of the course. Their journey towards reaching these goals (producing the texts) needs to be documented through annotation and task design. For the projects done by the students in the past, we could follow the same template; yet not all the texts are available as students in the past did not always follow the templates.</p>
<p>We need a UI to fill in details using this template. We also need to add more metadata to the documents that could guide the students. Tasks can be generated for students to practice various skills and techniques that will be highlighted through metadata.</p>
